Hello All,

I have created a tool for Indian Crypto lovers who love to trade on WazirX.com <BETA VERSION>

What does this tool do?
--> It alerts trader when his/her set price (Track Price) for selected Cryptocurrency on WazirX reaches to latest buy price at the moment.


How does it alert?

--> It makes a beep sound (like an alarm) when the set price is lower or higher than the current buy price of the selected cryptocurrency


Why we need this tool?

--> I observed that we mostly miss the moment when our desired crypto reaches some price where we wanted to trade(buy or sell) it.
--> In that case this tool beeps like an alarm and alerts a trader to pay attention to it and do trading (as we can't sit in front of the exchange console all time)


How to use it?

--> Download Tracker.exe on your computer (it totally safe and do not ask for any login details as its just a monitoring tool that works on the public API of WazirX)
--> In coin name dropdown select your crypto or you can write its name, it will display matching results
--> You can get the latest Buy/Sell Price of that crypto using the Get Price button (it's just to get the latest rate, nothing to do with creating an alert tracker)
--> Now Enter the value (you track price) in the Track Price textbox
--> Select radion button High or Low (if you select High, then when crypto's buy rate exceeds your track price it will alert and vice-versa)
--> Click on Create Tracker button to start the monitoring process in the background
--> A tracking job will be created in below box (Current Running Trackers)
--> When track price is High/Low than current crypto's buy price, your computer will make a beep sound alerting you about the current market situation of your selected Crypto
--> To stop the alert, select that tracker job from (Current Running Trackers) window and click Stop Tracker button, the job will be removed and beep sound will stop

::Note::

--> No malware or virus, just a tool written using Powershell Form and powershell language
--> Do not press Get Rate button too repeatadle, it will freeze as it will be fetching data and process
--> Only works on Windows (Tested on Windows 10)
