Hello All,

I have created a tool for Indian Crypto lovers who loves to trade on WazirX.com

What does this tool do?
--> It alerts trader when his/her set price (Track Price) for selected Cryptocurrency on WazirX reaches to latest buy price at the moment.


How does it alerts?
--> It makes beep sound (like an alarm) when the set price is lower or higher than current buy price of selected cryptocurreny


Why we need this tool?
--> I observed that we mostly miss the moment when our desired crypto reaches to some price where we wanted to trade(buy or sell) it.
--> In that case this tool beeps like alarm and alerts trader to pay attention on it and do trading (as we can't sit in front of exchange console all time)


How to use it?
--> Download Tracker.exe on you computer (it totally safe and do not ask for any login details as its just an monitoring toll that works on public API of WazirX)
--> In coin name dropdown select your crypto or you can write its name, it will display maching results
--> You can get latest Buy/Sell Price of that crypto using Get Price buttton (it's just to get latest rate, nothing to do with creating alert tracker)
--> Now Enter the value (you track price) in Track Price textbox
--> Select radion button High or Low (if you select High, then when crypto's buy rate exceeds you track price it will alert and vice-versa)
--> Click on Create Tracker button to start monitoring process in backgroud
--> When track price is High/Low than current crypto's buy price, your computer will make beep sound alerting you about current market situation of you selected Crypto
--> To stop the alert and its beep sound, click on Stop Tracker button



::Note::

--> If you want to create alert for multiple cryptos, you need to start multiple instances of this application.
--> One tracker windows will only monitor one crypto at a time.
